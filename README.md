To preserve paper based, its essential to store them in a controlled environment to prevent them from getting spoilt. Some of the ways to preserve paper based records include the following:
1.	STORAGE ENVIRONMENT.  This includes keeping the records in a cool, dry place to prevent mold, pests and light damage. Also avoid areas with high humidity and temperature fluctuation. Keeping records in a cool stable environment of about (60-70 degrees).

2.	PROPER HANDLING. This refers use of clean hands to avoid transferring oils and dirt for example one can even use gloves if necessary especially for delicate and very important papers.


3.	PROTECTION. Storing papers in boxes, folders that are acid free to prevent yellowing and fading. Being that acid free materials prevent chemical reactions that can damage papers. Also avoiding overcrowding of the boxes and keep folders loosely filled so that papers are not tightly packed to avoid spoilage.

4.	AVOIDING SUNLIGHT. Keeping the records away from direct sunlight and UV rays because they can fade and damage the papers overtime.


5.	SUPPORT. Storing papers vertically to prevent bending and warping of the papers for example use of book bends and book shelves inorder to keep them upright and away from spoilage hence preservation.

6.	PEST CONTROL. This includes implementation of regular inspections to prevent damage from insects and pests like rats from damaging the papers. This also includes putting away food stuffs away from the papers to avoid pests from damaging the paper records.

7.	DIGITIZATION. Consider digitization important records to reduce handling and potential damage. Digital copies provide a backup incase the physical copies degrade.

8.	LABELLING. Use soft pencils or acid-free labels to mark documents. Avoid ink which can bleed through the paper over time.

9.	WATER AND FIREPROOF STORAGE. Consider use of water and fireproof storage units for critical records.

10.	NON-PLASTIC MATERIALS. Avoid using non plastic binders, sleeves or covers that can emit harmful chemicals for example PVC plastic, which can cause deterioration overtime.

11.	ROUTINE INSPECTIONS. Conduct regular audits and condition assessments of the paper records to catch early signs of deterioration, mold, pests, or other damages.

12.	PRESERVATION OF DIGITAL RECORDS. Ensure that digital copies are stored in stable formats and that the digital storage methods are maintained and upgraded as technology evolves
